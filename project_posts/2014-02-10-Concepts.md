# Concept
## A-Noise
This experience explores human nature when thrown into simple discoverable competition and the impact of human noise and language when used in an arbitrary way.

## The Technology
WebApp using Voice API that detects mood or personality from voice sounds that are reflected visually in color. Rendered with GLSL shaders in webGL. Media Capture or WebRTC used to get a screen shot of user for avatar. A race where speed is determined by speed at which people articulate noise using WebRTC. Works as an installation and web based component.

## Ok, but seriously what is it?
Particiapants are unknowingly thrown into a competition with others.  

They walk up to a station with camera/microphone (or are requested to enable webcam) which creates an avatar visible to the other players.

Then all players are represented by their video/photo avatar and placed in a circle around a central glowing orb.

And the game begins.

All players are prompted to say something, anything.. just make a noise.

As they make a noise their avatar glows a color based on the interpreted mood of their voice. The glows bleed and blur into each other creating a painterly tie-die effect.

Their avatar moves a little towards the center and the player soons discovers the speed at which their avatar moves is related directly to the speed and volume at which they talk. But they don't only have to talk, they could make any sound. They could hoot and hollar like a coyote.

The race is on.

All players use their vocal abilities to move their avatar to the center orb. The first player to reach it is the winner causing the whole game surface to explode in a frenzy of color and music.

The winner gets the opportunity to brag on google plus and have a photo of themselves in the process of the game saved as a permanent part of the piece in the winner board, which is an array of all the winners that explode out of the center orb upon winning.

Thinking about a project..

A couple months isn't a lot of time to pull this off in my free time, so hopefully we'll get something cool out of it either way. I've jotted down themes and technologies to base concepts off of. 

## Goal
I want to say something interesting about the human condition that makes people think differently about themselves, others, and the world around them. 

## Themes
* love/relationships - beginning & ending
* hopes/disappointments
* nature/technology
* competition/play

## Technologies
* Leap Motion
* Mobile
* webGL
* webRTC
* Arduino
* Open Frameworks
